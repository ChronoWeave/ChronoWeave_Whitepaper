> A Groundbreaking Temporal Cognition Framework with Ethical Memory Capabilities

ChronoWeave is an advanced temporal cognition framework that provides AI systems with ethical memory capabilities through a sophisticated architecture combining time-layered data structures, regulatory compliance mechanisms, and ethical governance systems. It enables organizations to leverage AI while maintaining full control over how information is remembered, processed, and forgotten.

## Key Features

### Time-Layered Knowledge Graph (TLKG)

- **Temporal Relationships**: Track how information changes over time
- **Reference Time**: Access information as it existed at any point in time
- **Temporal Context**: Understand the historical context of information
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimize storage through temporal compression techniques

### Regulatory-Aware Ethical Suspension System (RA-ESS)

- **Ethical Dormancy States**: Control information access through soft_pause, sealed, and frozen states
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automatically enforce regulatory requirements
- **Consent Management**: Honor user consent preferences over time
- **Ethical Governance**: Implement ethical principles through configurable rules

### Temporal Integrity Framework (TIF)

- **Validation Mechanisms**: Verify temporal consistency of information
- **Enforcement Layer**: Prevent temporal paradoxes and inconsistencies
- **Audit Trails**: Track all changes to information over time
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements

### Comprehensive Compliance Features

- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI detection, classification, de-identification, encryption, and audit logging
- **FINRA Compliance**: Financial data protection, retention policies, data lifecycle management, and regulatory reporting
- **Cross-Industry Compliance**: Flexible framework adaptable to various regulatory requirements

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/chronoweave.git
cd chronoweave

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the development server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from chronoweave.client import ChronoWeaveClient

# Initialize client
client = ChronoWeaveClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Store an observation
client.observe({
    "node_type": "Observation",
    "content": {
        "observation_type": "CustomerPreference",
        "text": "Customer prefers email over phone calls",
        "observer_id": "agent_1"
    }
}, user_id="customer_123")

# Retrieve relevant information
results = client.recall({
    "text": "What are the customer's contact preferences?",
    "reference_time": "2023-07-01T12:00:00Z"
}, user_id="customer_123")

# Infuse context into a prompt
infused_prompt = client.infuse_prompt(
    "How should I contact the customer?",
    user_id="customer_123"
)
```

## Components

### Core Components

- **ChronoNode Schema**: A flexible schema for time-anchored information units
- **TimeLayered Knowledge Graph**: Stores and manages temporal relationships
- **ChronoSyncRetriever**: Sophisticated retrieval with temporal and semantic relevance
- **ContextInfuser**: Adds time-aware context to prompts
- **ConsentAwareMemory**: Manages privacy and data lifecycle

### API Endpoints

- `POST /observe`: Store new information
- `POST /recall`: Retrieve relevant information
- `POST /infuse`: Generate context-infused prompts
- `GET /nodes/{node_id}`: Retrieve specific nodes
- `PATCH /nodes/{node_id}`: Update existing nodes
- `DELETE /nodes/{node_id}`: Delete nodes
- `POST /consent`: Manage user consent settings

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support Agents**: Recall customer history, preferences, and past issues
- **Strategic Planning**: Analyze historical patterns and project future trends
- **Personal AI Assistants**: Remember user interactions with natural decay and reinforcement
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Share temporal context across agent teams

## Performance

ChronoWeave has been optimized for performance across various dimensions:

- **Core Operations**: 186 operations per second under full ethical load
- **Query Performance**: 60% faster than traditional graph databases for temporal queries
- **Write Performance**: 45% faster than traditional graph databases for temporal writes
- **Storage Efficiency**: 70%+ reduction in storage requirements through tiered storage and optimization
- **Cost Efficiency**: 65%+ cost savings compared to non-tiered approaches

## Development Status

ChronoWeave is currently in beta testing. We're focused on validating our compliance features and preparing for general availability. The beta program is structured in phases to ensure a smooth rollout of features and gather valuable feedback from users.

### Beta Testing Program

We're currently accepting applications for our beta testing program. If you're interested in participating, please visit our [beta testing portal](https://beta.chronoweave.ai) to apply.

#### Beta Phases

- **Beta 1 (Current)**: Core features and basic compliance capabilities
- **Beta 2**: Advanced compliance features and reporting
- **Beta 3**: Integration features and compliance dashboard
- **Beta 4**: Performance optimization and advanced features
- **Release Candidate**: Final testing before production

See our [Beta Testing Guide](docs/beta/README.md) for more information about the beta program, including feature availability, setup instructions, and feedback collection.

### Compliance Features

ChronoWeave includes comprehensive compliance features for HIPAA and FINRA regulations:

- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI detection, classification, encryption, de-identification, and compliance reporting
- **FINRA Compliance**: Financial data protection, retention policy management, data lifecycle management, and compliance rule engine

These features are designed to help organizations maintain compliance while leveraging the power of temporal cognition for AI.

## Monitoring

ChronoWeave includes a comprehensive monitoring system that tracks middleware performance, API usage, and system health. See [monitoring documentation](docs/monitoring.md) for details.

### Key Monitoring Features

- **Middleware Performance Tracking**: Monitor execution time, request counts, and errors
- **Prometheus Integration**: Collect and store metrics from the ChronoWeave API
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visualize metrics in pre-configured dashboards
- **Alerting**: Get notified when metrics exceed thresholds
