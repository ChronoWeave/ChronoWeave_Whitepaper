# ChronoWeave Documentation

Welcome to the ChronoWeave documentation. ChronoWeave is a groundbreaking temporal cognition framework that provides AI systems with ethical memory capabilities.

## What is ChronoWeave?

ChronoWeave is an advanced temporal cognition framework that provides AI systems with ethical memory capabilities through a sophisticated architecture combining time-layered data structures, regulatory compliance mechanisms, and ethical governance systems.

By integrating time-aware data structures with regulatory compliance mechanisms, ChronoWeave enables organizations to leverage AI while maintaining full control over how information is remembered, processed, and forgotten.

## Key Features

### Time-Layered Knowledge Graph (TLKG)

The TLKG is ChronoWeave's core data structure, providing a sophisticated framework for managing temporal information:

- **Temporal Relationships**: Track how information changes over time
- **Reference Time**: Access information as it existed at any point in time
- **Temporal Context**: Understand the historical context of information
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimize storage through temporal compression techniques

### Regulatory-Aware Ethical Suspension System (RA-ESS)

RA-ESS provides granular control over information accessibility:

- **Ethical Dormancy States**: Control information access through soft_pause, sealed, and frozen states
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automatically enforce regulatory requirements
- **Consent Management**: Honor user consent preferences over time
- **Ethical Governance**: Implement ethical principles through configurable rules

### Temporal Integrity Framework (TIF)

TIF ensures the consistency and reliability of temporal information:

- **Validation Mechanisms**: Verify temporal consistency of information
- **Enforcement Layer**: Prevent temporal paradoxes and inconsistencies
- **Audit Trails**: Track all changes to information over time
- **Compliance Verification**: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements

### Comprehensive Compliance Features

ChronoWeave includes built-in compliance capabilities for regulated industries:

- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI detection, classification, de-identification, encryption, and audit logging
- **FINRA Compliance**: Financial data protection, retention policies, data lifecycle management, and regulatory reporting
- **Cross-Industry Compliance**: Flexible framework adaptable to various regulatory requirements
